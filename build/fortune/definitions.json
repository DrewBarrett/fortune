If you *do* understand\nthe memo in question, but have absolutely nothing of substance to say, then\nyou have an excellent opportunity for a vicious ad hominem attack.  In fact,\nthe only *inappropriate* times for an ad hominem attack are as follows:\n\n\t1: When you agree completely with the author of an memo.\n\t2: When the author of the original memo is much bigger than you are.\n\t3: When replying to one of your own memos.\n",

  "\nLemma:  All horses are the same color.\nProof (by induction):\n\tCase n = 1: In a set with only one horse, it is obvious that all\n\thorses in that set are the same color.\n\tCase n = k: Suppose you have a set of k+1 horses.  Pull one of these\n\thorses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n\tof these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n\ttook out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n\thorses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n\tare all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all\n\thorses are the same color.\nTheorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.\nProof (by intimidation):\n\tEveryone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It\n\tis also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in\n\tback.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a\n\thorse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is\n\tinfinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.\n\tHowever, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an\n\tinfinite number of legs.  Well, that would be a horse of a different\n\tcolor; and by the Lemma, it doesn't exist.\n",

If any word is improper at the end of\na sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing\nmetaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.

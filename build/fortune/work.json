But Edison's\ngreatest achievement came in 1879, when he invented the electric company.\nEdison's design was a brilliant adaptation of the simple electrical circuit:\nthe electric company sends electricity through a wire to a customer, then\nimmediately gets the electricity back through another wire, then (this is\nthe brilliant part) sends it right back to the customer again.\n\nThis means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch of\nelectricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since very few\ncustomers take the time to examine their electricity closely. In fact the\nlast year any new electricity was generated in the United States was 1937;\nthe electric companies have been merely re-selling it ever since, which is\nwhy they have so much free time to apply for rate increases.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"What is Electricity?\"\n",

  "\nOne promising concept that I came up with right away was that you could\nmanufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that they be\ninstalled on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let's say your\ncongressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding study on how\nthe French government handles diseases transmitted by sherbet.  Just when he\ngot to the plane, his mandatory air bag, strapped around his waist, would\ninflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus rendering him too large to fit through the\nplane door.  It could also be rigged to inflate whenever the congressman\nproposed a law.  (\"Mr. Speaker, people ask me, why should October be\ndesignated as Cuticle Inspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.\")\nThis would save millions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the public\nwould violently support a law requiring airbags on congressmen.
